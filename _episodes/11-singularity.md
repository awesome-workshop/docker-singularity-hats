> ## Singularity
> Docker is the most popular containerization tool these days, particularly in industry, but it's not the only one. There are other kids on the block including Rocket and Singularity which are in use, but just haven't gained as much large-scale traction.

> Singularity in particular is used widely in HPC, and particularly by CMS, so you may have need to familiarize yourself with it at some point.

## Introduction

Analysis containers allow software development to occur on a local computer        
with the only requirement being that Docker is installed. The same containers 
can be run in GitLab CI/CD via Docker. These containers can also be run on 
LXPLUS, but this requires some additional steps.

When dealing with Analysis Containers, *privileged* containers are often needed. 
These are not available to you on LXPLUS (nor is the `docker`command). 
On LXPLUS, the tool to run containers is Singularity.
**The following commands will therefore all be run on LXPLUS**
(`lxplus7.cern.ch` or later specifically).

## Running custom images with Singularity

Some of the LHC experiments have scripts for running singularity that hide the complexity.
For the purpose of running a custom analysis image, Singularity must be run manually.

As an example, we are going to run a container using the `matthewfeickert/intro-to-docker`
image. Before running Singularity, you should set the cache directory (i.e.
the directory to which the images are being pulled) to a
place outside your AFS space (here we use the `tmp` directory):

~~~
export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR="/tmp/$(whoami)/singularity"
singularity shell -B /afs -B /eos -B /cvmfs docker://matthewfeickert/intro-to-docker:latest
# try accessing cvmfs inside of the container
source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If you are asked for a docker username and password, just hit
enter twice.

One particular difference from Docker is that the image
name needs to be prepended by `docker://` to tell Singularity that this
is a Docker image.
As you can see from the output, Singularity first downloads the layers
from the registry, and is then unpacking the layers into a format that
can be read by Singularity. This is somewhat a technical detail, but 
is different from Docker.

In the next example, we are executing a script with singularity using a Docker CERN Cent0S 7 image.

~~~
export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR="/tmp/$(whoami)/singularity"
singularity exec -B /afs -B /eos -B /cvmfs docker://cmssw/cc7:latest bash .gitlab/build.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## `exec` vs. `shell`
>
> Singularity differentiates between providing you with an
> interactive shell (`singularity shell`) and executing scripts
> non-interactively (`singularity exec`).
>
{: .callout}

> ## `-B` (bind strings)
>
> The -B option allows the user to specify paths to bind to the Singularity container.
> This option is similar to '-v' in docker. By default paths are mounted as rw (read/write),
> but can also be specified as ro (read-only).
>

## Authentication with Singularity

In case your image is not public, you can authenticate to
the registry in two different ways: either you append the
option `--docker-login` to the `singularity` command, which
makes sense when running interactively, or via environment
variables (e.g. on GitLab):

~~~
export SINGULARITY_DOCKER_USERNAME=${CERNUSER}
export SINGULARITY_DOCKER_PASSWORD='mysecretpass'
~~~
{: .language-bash}

> ## Exercise (5 min)
> Working from lxplus, use Singularity to pull the Docker image created in lesson 8 for the skimming repository and use this image to start an interactive Singularity container.

> > ## Solution
> > ~~~bash
> > export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR="/tmp/$(whoami)/singularity"
> > singularity shell -B /afs -B /eos -B /cvmfs docker://gitlab-registry.cern.ch/[repo owner's username]/[skimming repo name]:[branch name]-[shortened commit SHA] --docker-login
