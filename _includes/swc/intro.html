  Docker and Apptainer are platform as a service products which use OS-level virtualization within containers. Containerization brings a high level of flexibility, isolation, and reproducibility to your workflow. It also allows pieces of software to be run on an OS other than the one for which they were designed. This hands-on tutorial will introduce the Docker and Apptainer environments and show how working within a container is a powerful alternative to our traditional computer cluster centric workflow. We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of working within a container as well as the differences between Docker and Apptainer. Participants will also be introduced to some CMS/CVMFS focused containers and will get a chance to explore those environments. Within these containers users will have access to CVMFS and all of the software associated with it (i.e. CMSSW) as well as more graphics oriented software, like cmsShow, through X11 and VNC.
